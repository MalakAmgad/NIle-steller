## Project Details

Upon visiting NileStellar, users are greeted with an engaging dashboard presenting NASA bioscience papers. The **Smart Filter Tool** allows filtering by publication date, topic, organism, and more. Users can either:

* **Read the full paper**, or
* **Summarize key points** using AI.

Our **storytelling tool** converts research papers into interactive narratives, complete with images and text-to-speech. Users can also explore **interactive quizzes** and **Choose Your Adventure stories**, making learning about space biology fun and immersive.

Scientists and researchers benefit from the **What-If Scenario**, enabling safe, data-driven predictions without real-life experimentation. The platform also provides access to a curated collection of space images and active satellite data.

**Frontend Technology:** React + Vite, deployed via Vercel.
**Interactive Visuals:** React Three Fiber, drei, and Framer Motion.
